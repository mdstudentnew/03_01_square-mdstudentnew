# Square Lab
1.	Create a class called Square with a ```double side``` to represent a side's length.
2.	Add a public integer constant ```MAX_SIDE_LENGTH``` and set it to 10.
3.	Add a constructor that sets the side length through a double parameter.
4.	Add accessor ```getSide()``` and mutator ```setSide (double theSide)```.  
5.	Add a ```toString()``` method that returns "Square with side length = 4.0" (for example, if the square had a side of 4.0).
6.	Add method ```double area()``` to calculate the area of the square.
7.	Add method ```double diagonal()``` to calculate the length of a diagonal.
